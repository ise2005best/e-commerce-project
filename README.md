## ISESEN E-COMMERCE PROJECT

**Project Description:**

This repository contains code for a discontinued e-commerce project. It serves as a reference point for the evolution of the project and demonstrates the technical decisions made during its development.

**Initial Approach:**

The project was initially built utilizing Firebase Authentication and Firestore database due to their ease of implementation and scalability. However, upon further analysis and user feedback, the team identified the need for greater flexibility and control over data management.

**Transition to Node.js and MySQL:**

To address these needs, the team migrated the project to a Node.js backend and MySQL database. This shift offered several advantages, including:

* **Customizable data model:** Ability to tailor the database schema to specific needs.

**Current Status and Future Plans:**

While this repository represents a discontinued version of the project, its code serves as a valuable resource for understanding the initial development process and decisions made.
